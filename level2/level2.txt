JavaScript MA03
----------------
Level 2

1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.

- Code style is how different people write code. 
  One person can use ", another '. 
  Some like to use 2 or 4 spaces to indent while other uses tab. 
  Some companies have strict "Style Guides" the employees has to follow.

2. What is a Regular Expression?

- A regular expression is a JavaScript Object that is a pattern from
  which we use to match combinations of charaters.
  Like we did in Level 1 question 1.

3. What does the .random() method do?

- The .random() method generates a random number between 0 and 1.

4. What does the .sort() method do?

- The .sort() method can take items in an Array and sort them.

5. What does the .reverse() method do?

- The .reverse() method turns an Array "on the head".
  So the first element becomes the last, the second becomes
  second to last. And so on...

6. List two examples of bad JavaScript code.

- First example, my own delivery on js1 ma1, task 4 :

  for (hobbies in people) {
    console.log(people["0"].firstName + "'s hobbies are: " + people["0"].hobbies);
}
for (hobbies in people) {
    console.log(people["1"].firstName + "'s hobbies are: " + people["1"].hobbies);
}
for (hobbies in people) {
    console.log(people["2"].firstName + "'s hobbies are: " + people["2"].hobbies);
}

Why did I not loop it!

- Second example:

var a = 5;
var b = '5';
a == b;

so a string is the same as a number? Use the === instead.

7. What data types can a JSON object contain?

- A JavaScript object can contain the following data types:
    - Numbers
    - Strings
    - Booleans
    - Arrays
    - Null
    - Objects


8. What is minifying JavaScript Code?

- Minifying JavaScript code is when you compress your javascript code to a shorter code.
  Example:
  
  function hi(yourName){
    console.log('well hi there, ' + yourName);
  }
  hi('Sondre Nordjore);
  
  can be compressed to:
  
  function hi(a){console.log('Well hi there, '+a)}hi("Sondre Nordjore");
  
  That makes the code co down from 86 to 70 signs.

9. What is a global variable?

- A global variable is a variable which is declared outside a function. Usually in the beginning of the code. Be careful about using global variables since if the same variable is used in a function it can change value and affect your other code.
